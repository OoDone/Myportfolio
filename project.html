          <h1 class="text-center">Watercooled 1000Amp metal melter</h1>
          <p>This is one of my most recent projects, and one of the hardest. It took me many weeks overall and taught me a lot. I learned to never 3d print objects without looking it over and making sure everything fits before printing. I also learned that 3d printing is not even close to watersealed, and will spray you in the face. Attaching the pump rotor to the motor shaft is probably the hardest part. I had to put it all together, seal it, test it, and get ready to permanently add a extra layer for sealing. I added the layer, then proceeded to overpower the motor when there was air and water coming in, causing the rotor to get jolted really hard and break off. I also learned that it is a VERY good idea to plan ahead and make sure you have the parts to work before doing a modification. Without water cooling, the tip would heat up the heatsinks on the end of the saftey pole causing the hole securing system to get hot, and melt the wire cover. I found this out and decided to watercool it, the watercooling works great, the tip of the bolt can get to metal melting temperatures, while the heatsinks on the bolt only warm up, not hot enough to burn you.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Car radio aux input mod</h2>
          <div class="section-container-spacer">
            <p>My car's A/C was making a weird sound, so I decided to check it out. Upon inspection, I found a basketball size of grass, leaves, etc in the filter compartment with a chewed up filter. I got a new filter and while I was doing this kind of stuff, I decided to check out my old idea of adding aux input to the car. I took out the radio and brought it inside to dissassemble. After about an hour of dissassembly, I did some research on how to add aux input. I discovered the tape deck has a connecter to the main motherboard, and uses labeled pins. The pins I wanted were CSL, CSR, and SGND2, CSL stands for Cassette left, CSR cassette left, and SGND2 for ground. I soldered speaker wire to the board and added a 3.5mm headphone jack to the other end. I went out to test it, plugged in the radio, plugged in my phone. I turned it on and it didn't see a cassette so it wouldn't work. I put a cassette to aux adapter(Lower quality) in the slot so it sees a cassette. This time the music started playing. I was happy with it where it was, but my dad gave me the idea to keep going. I decided I wanted to make it think there was a tape in there when there wasn't so it didn't need a tape inserted to work. I disassembled the radio again taking the cassette deck off. I found a switch called "LOAD" so I put a peice of tape on it and reassembled the radio. I went to test it, it didn't work, instead repeatedly tried to do the cassette load procedure, causing the deck to break(I wasn't aware of it yet). I brought it back inside and disassembled it again, only this time, the cassette deck fell apart, I thought I could fix it, so I tried with no luck. I didn't mind to much as it made it easier to trick the deck(or so I thought). After doing more research, I found out all I needed to do was jam a screwdriver in there, but ofcourse I had broken it, so that wouldn't work anymore. We troubleshooted by using a variable powersupply to run the mode changer motor(I didn't know at the time, but it would break it completely). After a lot more research, I realized I had messed up, and before I powered the motor, I could have tricked it, but since I moved the motor, The stereo thought the motor was in a different position than it was. This caused it to jam the motor and heat it up when I tested it. My dad was convinced I was done for, and started looking at alternite options, but I wasn't convinced. I proceeded to mess around for the rest of the day to no avail. My dad told me there was a fix that used a $70 part, so I decided to leave the deck alone so it could still be put into the stereo as to not confuse it. The part tricks the stereo into thinking its a cd changer, when its actually just a aux input port. I learned that I shouldn't be so quick to try things without doing the research, as it caused me to lose $70.</p>
